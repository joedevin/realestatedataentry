# Real Estate Data Entry
Web App to input and locally store Real Estate Acquisition Data

# Overview
This is a webapp written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. It's for agencies or companies that acquire Real Estate rights on behalf of clients or the public. It allows the user to input basic information about the Tract of property. Once a tract is created in the system, you can select it and it will show a checklist of the steps towards a full acquisition. 

The data is saved locally. 

The purpose of writing this was to create some ease of keeping track of the several parcels being acquired for a given project at my day job.
